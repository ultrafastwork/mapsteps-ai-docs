### Bugfixing works:
- [ ] Widget positioning on desktop is currently unstable and behaves inconsistently.
- [ ] The default layout applied when adding a widget to a row is visually poor — consider using improved presets or more suitable default values.
- [ ] The default Button Size field appears empty instead of showing a default value.
- [ ] The Font Size setting in the second row does not update in the live preview, though it applies after saving — and incorrectly affects the third row as well.
- [ ] The WYSIWYG editor in the HTML 2 Widget is too simple, make it to have same amount of toolbar items like in HTML 1 Widget.
- [ ] When the logo is centered, layout alignment becomes incorrect if a menu widget is placed on the left or right side.
- [ ] The Button Widget is automatically centered across all desktop row layouts, even when it should follow row alignment.
- [ ] Mobile widget positioning breaks due to flex: auto applied on the selector: `.wpbf-header-column.wpbf-column-grow.`


### Heavy works:
- [ ] Move the “Premium” and “Theme Settings” options into the Desktop Menu section.
- [ ] Hide the “Menu Items Spacing” control when the selected menu type does not support spacing.
- [ ] Enabling “Main Row Sticky Header” should automatically hide the Top Row sticky toggle/checkbox.
- [ ] “Top Row Sticky Header” should function as a single toggle, inheriting its behavior from the main row sticky settings.
- [ ] Sticky navigation is currently not functioning at all.
